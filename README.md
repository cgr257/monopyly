# monopyly
This is a Monopoly board game simulator written in python which compiles statistics about the likelihood of landing on each space.

The user specifies the number of players per game, the number of turns per game, and the number of games to be played. The simulator then rolls dice for each player and moves them around the board, tracking the spaces that they land on. Statistics are printed out at the end of each game and at the end of the set of games.

Currently the simulator does not take into consideration things like chance, community chest, or jail, but I do plan to include those game elements eventually.

The script works but it is clearly incomplete. I will work on it as I have time, but it is not a high priority.
